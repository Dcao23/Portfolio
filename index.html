      <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
      <p>I am an aspiring software web developer currently enrolled in a full-stack part time bootcamp. My interest began in the field of Kinesiology or what may be more familiar to most people is Sports Medicine/Exercise Science. Growing up I've always had a liking for sports and a passion for body building. My original plan was to pursue Physical Therapy school upon graduating with from UNC Charlotte with a Bachelors degree in Exercise Science. As years gone by and being unsure about my career path I finally decided that it was time for a change. I continued to do some more research and wanted to explore more in the field of technology. With the advancement in the job market for remote work, my interest grew. Now I am able to develop online and network with liked minded individuals in this field.
